# Link an Application to a Twilio Number

To link an application to a Twilio number, you can use the following command:

```bash
sipnet:numbers:linkTwilioNumber 
```

You will be asked to enter a number already existing in your Twilio account and the application you want to link to that number. Once you have entered this information, the application will be linked to the Twilio number.

Example of linking a Twilio number to an application:

```bash
This utility will help you create an Application.
Press ^C at any time to quit.
✔ Number to link (E.164 format) +17853178070
✔ Friendly Name Peters AI
✔ Application Julian at Papaton
✔ Twilio Account SID ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
✔ Twilio Auth Token
? Ready? (Y/n)
```

To confirm that the application was linked successfully, you can run the following command:

```bash
fonoster numbers:list
```

Your output should show the newly linked Twilio number. Here is an example of what the output might look like:

```bash
REF                                     NAME                          TEL URL
