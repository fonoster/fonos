# Introduction 

This section provides a step-by-step approach to configuring and running a Voice AI assistant with Fonoster Autopilot. You'll learn how to set up the assistant's conversational behavior and language model settings, run it as a Docker container, and expose it to external callers using Ngrok. You'll also discover how to use Fonoster CTL to log in to your workspace with an API key, create a new assistant, and connect that assistant to a Twilio phone number.
