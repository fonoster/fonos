# Introduction

Self-hosting Fonoster involves running Fonoster's server on your data center. Self-hosting is helpful if you want to run Fonoster on a private network or if you want to customize Fonoster's behavior. While this offers more flexibility, it also requires more technical knowledge, and some features may not be available.
