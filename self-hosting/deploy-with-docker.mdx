Docker is the easiest way to deploy a self-hosted instance of Fonoster. This guide will walk you through deploying the Fonoster services using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite for Fonoster is to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on the host machine.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the environment">

First, you'll need to create a new directory in your preferred location and change it. The root directory we will use in the guide is `fonoster.`

```bash
mkdir -p fonoster/config
cd fonoster
```

Then, copy the `.env.example` from the repository to the current directory and rename it to `.env.` This file contains all the environment variables that the services need to run. You can use the following command to copy the file:

```bash
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fonoster/fonoster/master/.env.example
curl -o ./compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fonoster/fonoster/master/compose.yaml
curl -o ./config/integrations.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fonoster/fonoster/master/config/integrations.example.json
curl -o ./config/envoy.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fonoster/fonoster/master/config/envoy.yaml
```

Then, open the `.env` file with your favorite editor and update the following variables:

* `DOCKER_HOST_ADDRESS`: The public IP address of your Docker host. If running locally, you can use your local IP address. If you are running the application on a server, you must use a routable IP address for the server.

* `ASTERISK_SIPPROXY_HOST`: Set this variable to the IP address of the host machine.

In addition to the previous variables, you should update all the secrets and ensure the `.env` file is safely stored.

<Step title="Generate keys">
Next, generate a set of public and private keys for the server. You can use the following command to generate the keys:

```bash
mkdir -p config/keys
openssl genpkey -algorithm rsa -out config/keys/private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
openssl rsa -pubout -in config/keys/private.pem -out config/keys/public.pem
chmod 644 config/keys/*
```

Your directory structure should look like this:

```bash
.
├── .env
├── compose.yaml
└── config
    ├── envoy.yaml
    ├── integrations.json
    └── keys
        ├── private.pem
        └── public.pem

3 directories, 6 files
```

<Note>
  The integrations.json file contains the credentials for the integrations (stt, tts, etc). You must update this file with the correct credentials for the integrations you want to use.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Start the server">
Finally, run the following command to start the application:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

After a few moments, you can interact with Fonoster using the API or SDK.
