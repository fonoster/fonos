Fonoster uses a Workspace-centric approach, meaning all operations are performed against a specific Workspace. By default, when you self-host Fonoster, it automatically creates a default Workspace along with a default username and password.

```text
Default accessKeyId: WO00000000000000000000000000000000
Default username: admin@fonoster.local
Default password: changeme
```

You must create API keys to log in to a Workspace and perform operations.

## Create an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the environment">
    First, create a new folder (e.g., fonoster-apikeys-demo) and navigate to it.
    
    ```bash
    mkdir fonoster-apikeys-demo
    cd fonoster-apikeys-demo
    npm init -y
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Install the `@fonoster/sdk` package.
    
    ```bash
    npm install @fonoster/sdk
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the script">
    Once the installation is complete, create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code:
  
    ```javascript
    const SDK = require("@fonoster/sdk");
    
    // Replace these with your actual values
    const client = new SDK.Client({ 
      accessKeyId: "WO00000000000000000000000000000000",
      endpoint: "localhost:50051",
      allowInsecure: true
    });
    
    // Use your actual username and password here
    client.login("admin@fonoster.local", "changeme").then(async () => {
      const apikeys = new SDK.ApiKeys(client);
    
      apikeys.createApiKey({
        role: "WORKSPACE_ADMIN",
      }).then((result) => {
        console.log(result);
      });
    });
    ```
    
    Finally, run the script.
    
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

If everything goes well, you should see the new API key printed to the console, and you can use it to log in to your Workspace.
