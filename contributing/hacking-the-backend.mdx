This guide contains the development environment setup for Fonoster. It includes the API Server and supporting infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

[](https://github.com/truecaller/web-callhero-dev-env/tree/1f26e774d9b32d699262b6aa52265af04ef24af1#prerequisites)

* Docker and Docker Compose

* NodeJS >= v20

* Git (Optional)

### Hacking the Backend

To start hacking the backend, start by cloning the project, and copying the *.env.example.dev* and *./config/integrations.example.json*

Here is an example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fonoster/fonoster
cd fonoster
cp .env.example.dev .env
cp config/integrations.example.json config/integrations.json
```

In the *.env* file you will need to find and update the following variables. All variables will need to be updated to a routable IP within your local environment.

* ROUTR\_EXTERNAL\_ADDRS

* ROUTR\_RTPENGINE\_HOST

* ASTERISK\_SIPPROXY\_HOST

* APISERVER\_ROUTR\_API\_ENDPOINT

<Tip>
  With `ifconfig | grep "en0" -A 5` on Linux or Mac you will see a good candidate to use as the IP.
</Tip>

Next, you need to install and build the project.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
```

Then, you need to start the infrastructure and initialize the database using the following commands:

```bash
npm run start:services
npm run db:migrate
```

The previous command will start all the services including `envoy`, `mailhog`, `adminer`, `influxdb`, `postgres`, and `asterisk`.

Finally, start the API Server with:

```bash
npm run start:apiserver
```

### Running the Integration Tests

A good indicator that your environment is correctly setup is having ALL passing in your integration tests. Run the integration test, on a separate terminal, with the following command:

```bash
npm run integration
```
