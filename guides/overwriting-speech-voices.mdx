When creating a voice application, you will define the voice used to speak the text. To illustrate this, let's define a simple voice application using _Deepgram_ for speech-to-text using the SDK:

```javascript create-app.js {10-13}
const SDK = require("@fonoster/sdk");

const client = new SDK.Client({ accessKeyId: "WO000000000000000000000000000000" });

const appConfig = {
  name: "Custom Voice App",
  type: "EXTERNAL",
  endpoint: "0.tcp.ngrok.io:17263",
  speechToText: {
    productRef: "stt.deepgram",
    config: {
      languageCode: "en-US"
    }
  },
  textToSpeech: {
    productRef: "tts.deepgram",
    config: {
      voice: "aura-asteria-en"
    }
  }
}

client.loginWithApiKey("AP0eerv2g7qow3e950k7twu4rvydcunq3k", "fNc...")
  .then(async() => new SDK.Applications(client).createApplication(appConfig))
  .catch(console.error);
```

And now, let's create a simple voice application using the `Say` verb:

```javascript voice-server.js
const VoiceServer = require("@fonoster/voice").default;

new VoiceServer().listen(async (req, response) => {
  // Verbs go here
  await response.answer();
  await response.say("Hello World!");
  await response.hangup();
});
```

The application in the example above uses the speech settings described in the application configuration. The `Say` verb will use the voice defined in the `textToSpeech` object. In this case, the voice used is "aura-asteria-en".

If you want to overwrite the voice the `Say` verb uses, you can pass the _voice_ attribute to the `say` method. Here is an example:

```javascript voice-server.js {7}
const VoiceServer = require("@fonoster/voice").default;

new VoiceServer().listen(async (req, response) => {
  // Verbs go here
  await response.answer();
  await response.say("Hello World by Aura Asteria!");
  await response.say("Hello World by Aura Luna!", { voice: "aura-luna-en" });
  await response.hangup();
});
```

In the example above, the first `say` method will use the "aura-asteria-en" voice, and the second `say` method will use the "aura-luna-en" voice. The _voice_ attribute is optional. If you don't pass it, the `Say` verb will use the voice defined in the application configuration.
