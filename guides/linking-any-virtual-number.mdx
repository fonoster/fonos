This guide provides step-by-step instructions for connecting your SIP provider with Fonoster. It covers creating SIP credentials, configuring trunks, and linking numbers. 

<Note>
The preferred way to link a Twilio number is to use the `sipnet:numbers:linkTwilioNumber` command.
</Note>

## SIP Authentication (If required)

If your VoIP provider requires SIP authentication, you must add the credentials in Fonoster for outbound (towards your provider) calling.

Run the following command and follow the interactive prompts:

```bash
fonoster sipnet:credentials:create
```

Request the credentials to your VoIP provider.

## Static IP Authentication (If required)

If your provider authenticates using static IP addresses, please give them IP `165.22.7.155`.

They will use the value to validate the origin of the signaling.

## Creating and configuring a Trunk

After setting up the credentials (if needed), configure your trunk. Before creating the trunk, please verify the preferred transport protocol with your provider and use it for your _Outbound URI_.

Run the command below to create your Trunk:

```bash
fonoster sipnet:trunks:create
```

Follow the prompts to complete the trunk configuration, ensuring that the _Outbound URI_ is set according to your provider's requirements and the _Inbound URI_ ends with `.sip.fonoster.com`

For example, if your company's name is **Acme Corp**, you could use `acme.sip.fonoster.com` as your _Inbound URI_.

<Note>
The _Inbound URI_ is globally unique. If you get an error, try using another value.
</Note>

## Creating the virtual number

Next, create a virtual number that will be used to route incoming SIP traffic. Execute the following command:

```bash
fonoster sipnet:numbers:create
```

You will be prompted to provide the details of the number.

Please ensure that the number matches what your provider will send in the **FROM** header of the SIP traffic. Any discrepancy will prevent successful traffic matching, and the calls will fail.

### Handling number conflicts

If you encounter an error message such as "Number already exists" during creation, please contact the [Fonoster support team](https://discord.gg/4QWgSz4hTC). They will assist in resolving any conflicts with existing numbers.

## Quick reference for Twilio users

For Twilio customers, it is recommended to use the following command to link an existing number:

```bash
fonoster sipnet:numbers:linkTwilioNumber
```

This command simplifies the process by automatically linking your virtual Twilio number with Fonoster, streamlining your integration.
