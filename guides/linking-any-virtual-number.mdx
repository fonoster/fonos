This guide will walk you through connecting your SIP provider to Fonoster by setting up authentication, configuring a SIP trunk, and creating your virtual number. Follow the steps below to link any virtual number to your application.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Authentication">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="SIP Authentication (If required)">
        If your VoIP provider requires SIP authentication, run the following command and follow the interactive prompts:

        ```bash
        fonoster sipnet:credentials:create
        ```

        After running this command, please request the necessary credentials from your provider.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Static IP Authentication (If required)">
        If your provider uses static IP authentication, provide them with the following IP address:

        **165.22.7.155**

        This IP is used to verify the origin of the signaling.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your SIP Trunk">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Verify Provider Protocol">
        Before creating your trunk, verify with your provider the preferred transport protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, or TLS). Use the same protocol when specifying your _Outbound URI_.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Create a SIP Trunk">
        Run the following command to create your trunk:

        ```bash
        fonoster sipnet:trunks:create
        ```

        Follow the prompts to complete the configuration. Make sure that your _Inbound URI_ ends with **.sip.fonoster.com**. For example, if your company is **Acme Corp**, you might use:

        ```
        acme.sip.fonoster.com
        ```

        <Note>
          The _Inbound URI_ must be globally unique. If you receive an error, please try using a different value.
        </Note>
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create and Link Your Virtual Number">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Creating the Virtual Number">
        With your trunk in place, create a virtual number to route incoming SIP traffic. Execute the command below:

        ```bash
        fonoster sipnet:numbers:create
        ```

        You will be prompted for the details of your virtual number. **Important:** Ensure that this number exactly matches the value your provider sends in the **FROM** header of the SIP traffic. Any discrepancy may prevent proper traffic matching.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Handling Number Conflicts">
        If you encounter an error such as "Number already exists," please contact the [Fonoster support team](https://discord.gg/4QWgSz4hTC). They will help resolve any conflicts with existing numbers.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Quick Verification">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Verify Your Virtual Number">
        To check that your virtual number has been linked successfully, list your numbers with:

        ```bash
        fonoster sipnet:numbers:list
        ```
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Test Your Setup">
        Once the number is linked, try making a call to your virtual number to ensure that your voice application is accessible.
      </Accordion>
