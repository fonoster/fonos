This guide will walk you through connecting your SIP provider to Fonoster by setting up authentication, configuring a SIP trunk, and creating your virtual number. Follow the steps below to link any virtual number to your application.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request early access">
    To get started, you need to request early access to Fonoster. You can do this by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/fonoster/discussions/695">GitHub Discussions</a> and following the instructions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Authentication">
    ### SIP Authentication (If required)
    If your VoIP provider requires SIP authentication, run the following command and follow the interactive prompts:

    ```bash
    fonoster sipnet:credentials:create
    ```

    After running this command, please request the necessary credentials from your provider.

    ### Static IP Authentication (If required)
    If your provider uses static IP authentication, provide them with the following IP address:

    **165.22.7.155**

    This IP is used to verify the origin of the signaling.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your SIP Trunk">
    ### Verify Provider Protocol
    Before creating your trunk, verify with your provider the preferred transport protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, or TLS). Use the same protocol when specifying your _Outbound URI_.

    ### Create a SIP Trunk
    Run the following command to create your trunk:

    ```bash
    fonoster sipnet:trunks:create
    ```

    Follow the prompts to complete the configuration. Make sure that your _Inbound URI_ ends with **.sip.fonoster.com**. For example, if your company is **Acme Corp**, you might use:

    ```
    acme.sip.fonoster.com
    ```

    <Note>
      The _Inbound URI_ must be globally unique. If you receive an error, please try using a different value.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create and Verify Your Virtual Number">
    ### Creating the Virtual Number
    With your trunk in place, create a virtual number to route incoming SIP traffic. Execute the command below:

    ```bash
    fonoster sipnet:numbers:create
    ```

    You will be prompted for the details of your virtual number. **Important:** Ensure that this number exactly matches the value your provider sends in the **FROM** header of the SIP traffic. Any discrepancy may prevent proper traffic matching.

    ### Handling Number Conflicts
    If you encounter an error such as "Number already exists," please contact the [Fonoster support team](https://discord.gg/4QWgSz4hTC). They will help resolve any conflicts with existing numbers.

    ### Verify Your Setup
    To check that your virtual number has been linked successfully, list your numbers with:

    ```bash
    fonoster sipnet:numbers:list
    ```

    Once the number is linked, try making a call to your virtual number to ensure that your voice application is accessible.
  </Step>

<Tip>
  If you are linking a Twilio number, consider using the dedicated command 
  <code>fonoster sipnet:numbers:linkTwilioNumber</code> for a simplified process.
