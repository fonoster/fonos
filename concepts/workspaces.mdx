Workspaces in Fonoster allow you to organize and secure your resources. All resources within a Workspace are accessible to all members of the Workspace. Similarly, a set of API Keys created within a Workspace will have access to all resources in the Workspace according to the permissions granted to the API Key.

Once a Workspace is created, you can invite other users to join the Workspace and collaborate on resources.

## Workspace resources

Within a Workspace, you will have the ability to create and manage the following resources:

* Applications

* Virtual Numbers

* SIP Trunks

* SIP Credentials

* SIP Access Control Lists

* SIP Domains and Agents

* CDRs

* API Keys

* Secrets

* Etc
