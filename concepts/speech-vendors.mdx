Speech vendors in Fonoster provide speech-to-text and text-to-speech services for applications. Speech vendors are used to convert speech into text and text into speech.

## Overview

Both _AUTOPILOT_ and _EXTERNAL_ applications use speech APIs. To illustrate the use of speech in Fonoster, look at the following example using the SDK:

```javascript
const SDK = require("@fonoster/sdk");

const client = new SDK.Client({ accessKeyId: "WO000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" });

const appConfig = {
  name: "Custom Voice App",
  type: "EXTERNAL",
  endpoint: "0.tcp.ngrok.io:17263",
  speechToText: {
    productRef: "stt.deepgram",
    config: {
      languageCode: "en-US"
    }
  },
  textToSpeech: {
    productRef: "tts.deepgram",
    config: {
      voice: "aura-asteria-en"
    }
  }
}

client.loginWithApiKey("AP0eerv2g7qow3e950k7twu4rvydcunq3k", "fNc...")
  .then(async() => new SDK.Applications(client).createApplication(appConfig))
  .catch(console.error);
```

In the example above, we create a new voice application using the SDK. The application is configured to use Deepgram for speech-to-text and text-to-speech. The application is also configured to use the "aura-asteria-en" voice for text-to-speech.

In Fonoster, you can mix and match speech vendors to suit your needs. For example, you can use Deepgram for speech-to-text and Google for text-to-speech.

## Configuring speech-to-text

The _speechToText_ object allows you to define the speech-to-text engine to use. The speech-to-text engine is responsible for converting the caller's speech into text.

The _speechToText_ object has the _productRef_ and _config_ properties. The _productRef_ property identifies the speech-to-text vendor you want to use. The _config_ property is an object that contains the configuration settings for the speech-to-text engine. The configuration settings vary depending on the vendor.

Currently, only *Deepgram* is supported as a speech-to-text vendor, but we are working on adding more vendors.

### Deepgram configuration

_Deepgram_ is a speech-to-text vendor that provides high-quality transcription services. Deepgram supports the _languageCode_ as well as _model_ properties. The _languageCode_ property is the language code of the speech you want to transcribe. The _model_ property is the model to use for transcription and defaults to `nova-2-phonecall`.

The Autopilot supports the models `nova-2`, `nova-2-phonecall`, and `nova-2-conversationalai`.

Example of a Deepgram configuration for Spanish:

```javascript
const appConfig = {
  ...
  speechToText: {
    productRef: "stt.deepgram",
    config: {
      model: "nova-2"
      languageCode: "es",
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

<Note>
For _languageCode_ other than `en-US`, you need to use the `nova-2` model. 
  
Please refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/models-languages-overview) for more information.
</Note>

## Configuring text-to-speech

The _textToSpeech_ object allows you to define the text-to-speech engine. The text-to-speech engine is responsible for converting the Autopilot's responses into speech.

The _textToSpeech_ object has the _productRef_ and _config_ properties. The _productRef_ property identifies the text-to-speech vendor you want to use. The _config_ property is an object that contains the configuration settings for the text-to-speech engine. The configuration settings vary depending on the vendor.

We currently support *Google*, *Azure*, *Deepgram*, and *ElevenLabs* as text-to-speech vendors.

Most vendors only support the _voice_ property as the voice for the text-to-speech. The voice is a string that represents the voice to use. The available voices depend on the vendor.

Please visit the vendor's documentation for more information on the available voices.

<Tip>
  In addition to the *voice* property, the _ElevenLabs_ vendor supports the *model* property. The *model* property is the model to use for text-to-speech and defaults to `eleven_flash_v2_5`.
  Please refer to the [ElevenLabs documentation](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/developer-guides/models) for additional information about the available models.
</Tip>

Example of a text-to-speech configuration for *ElevenLabs*:

```javascript
const appConfig = {
  ...
  textToSpeech: {
    productRef: "tts.elevenlabs",
    config: {
      voice: "CaJslL1xziwefCeTNzHv",
      model: "eleven_flash_v2_5"
    }
  },
  ...
}
```
