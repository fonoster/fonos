Fonoster's Autopilot is a component within the platform that allows you to create powerful conversational experiences. It is built on top of Fonoster Programmable Voice, and takes advantage of the latest advances in large language models (LLMs) to provide a more natural and engaging experience for users.

<Warning>
The Autopilot is currently in overview mode an only available via the SDK.

## Creating an Autopilot Application

Use the SDK to create an Autopilot application. The following is an example of how to create a simple voice application using the OpenAI GPT-4o model:

```javascript
import SDK from "@fonoster/sdk";

const client = SDK.Client({ accessKeyId: "WO000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" });

const appConfig = {
  name: "My First Autopilot Application",
  type: "AUTOPILOT",
  speechToText: {
    productRef: "stt.deepgram",
    config: {
      languageCode: "en-US"
    }
  },  
  textToSpeech: {
    productRef: "tts.deepgram",
    config: {
      voice: "aura-asteria-en"
    }
  },
  intelligence: {
    productRef: "llm.groq",
    config: {
      conversationSettings: {
        firstMessage: "Hello, this is Olivia from Dr. Green's Family Medicine. How can I assist you today?",
        systemTemplate: "You are a Customer Service Representative. You are here to help the caller with their needs."
      },
      languageModel: {
        provider: "groq",
        model: "llama-3.3-70b-specdec",
        maxTokens: 250,
        temperature: 0.7  
      }
    }
  }
}

client.loginWithApiKey("AP0eerv2g7qow3e950k7twu4rvydcunq3k", "fNc...")
  .then(async() => new SDK.Applications(client).createApplication(appConfig))
  .catch(console.error);
```
