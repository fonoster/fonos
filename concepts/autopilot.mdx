Fonoster's Autopilot is a component within the platform that allows you to create powerful conversational experiences. It is built on top of Fonoster [Programmable Voice](./programmable-voice) and uses the latest advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide a natural and engaging experience.

## Overview

The following is an example of creating an Autopilot application using the SDK.

First, add the following content to a file named `appConfig.yaml`:

```yaml appConfig.yaml {2}
name: "Awesome Autopilot"
type: "AUTOPILOT"
speechToText:
  productRef: "stt.deepgram"
  config:
    model: "nova-3"
    languageCode: "en-US"
textToSpeech:
  productRef: "tts.deepgram"
  config:
    voice: "aura-asteria-en"
intelligence:
  productRef: "llm.groq"
  config:
    conversationSettings:
      firstMessage: "Hello, I'm your AI asssitant."
      systemPrompt: |
        You are a Customer Service Representative. You are here to help the caller with their needs.
      goodbyeMessage: "Thank you so much, bye!"
      systemErrorMessage: "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you please repeat it?"
      vad:
        activationThreshold: 0.3
        deactivationThreshold: 0.15
        debounceFrames: 1
      idleOptions:
        message: "Are you still there?"
    languageModel:
      provider: "groq"
      model: "llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
      maxTokens: 240
      temperature: 0.4
      tools: []
```

Then, create a script to apply the configuration as follows:

```javascript apply-autopilot-config.js
const fs = require("fs");
const yaml = require("js-yaml");
const SDK = require("@fonoster/sdk");

const client = new SDK.Client({ accessKeyId: "WO00000000000000000000000000000000" });

const appConfig = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync("./appConfig.yaml", "utf8"));

client.loginWithApiKey("AP0eerv2g7qow3e950k7twu4rvydcunq3k", "fNc...")
  .then(() => (new SDK.Applications(client)).createApplication(appConfig))
  .catch(console.error);
```

Please note that you must install the `js-yaml` and the `@fonoster/sdk` dependencies in your Node.JS project.

Once you create the application, you can use the *updateApplication* function instead of *createApplication* to quickly iterate over your Autopilot.

## General configuration

The Autopilot configuration is divided into a general section and three sub-sections: *speechToText*, *textToSpeech*, and *intelligence*.

The general section contains *name*, *type*, and *endpoint* properties.

The *name* property is the name of the Autopilot application. The *type* property is the type of the application, which should always be set to `AUTOPILOT`. The *endpoint* is an optional property allowing you to specify the endpoint for self-hosted Autopilots.

## Speech settings

Autopilot applications support a variety of speech-to-text and text-to-speech vendors. The *speechToText* and *textToSpeech* objects allow you to define the speech-to-text and text-to-speech engines to use.

You can mix and match vendors to suit your needs. For example, you can use *Deepgram* for speech-to-text and Google for text-to-speech. Please check the [Speech Vendors](./speech-vendors) section for more information on configuring speech-to-text and text-to-speech.

## Conversational settings

The *conversationSettings* object allows you to define the Autopilot's conversational behavior. The conversation settings are independent of the language model used.

The following is a list of the supported settings:

| Setting                     | Description                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| firstMessage                | The first message the Autopilot will say when the conversation starts                                                    |
| systemPrompt                | A prompt that describes the behavior of the Autopilot and sets the context of the conversation                           |
| systemErrorMessage          | The message the Autopilot will say when an error occurs                                                                  |
| maxSessionDuration          | The maximum time in milliseconds the conversation can last. Default to `30 x 60 x 1000 ms` (30 minutes)                  |

| initialDtmf                 | A DTMF to play when the conversation starts                                                                              |
| transferOptions             | The options to transfer the call to a live agent                                                                         |
| transferOptions.phoneNumber | The phone number to transfer the call to                                                                                 |
| transferOptions.message     | The message to play before transferring the call                                                                         |
| transferOptions.timeout     | The time in milliseconds to wait before hanging up the call if the transfer is incomplete. Default to `30000 ms`         |
| idleOptions                 | The options to handle idle time during the conversation                                                                  |
| idleOptions.message         | The message to play after the idle time is reached                                                                       |
| idleOptions.timeout         | The time in milliseconds to wait before playing the idle message. Defaults to `10000 ms`                                 |
| idleOptions.maxTimeoutCount | The maximum number of times the idle message will be played before hanging up the call                                   |
| vad                         | The voice activity detection settings                                                                                    |
| vad.activationThreshold     | The activation threshold for the voice activity detection. Default to `0.3`                                              |
| vad.deactivationThreshold   | The deactivation threshold for the voice activity detection. Default to `0.25`                                           |

A few noteworthy settings include the *maxSpeechWaitTimeout*, *initialDtmf*, *idleOptions*, and *vad*.

### Max Speech Wait Timeout

The *maxSpeechWaitTimeout* property allows you to specify the maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the caller before returning the speech-to-text result. If the caller does not speak within the specified time, the speech-to-text engine will return the result.

A value that is too low may result in the speech-to-text engine returning the result before the caller finishes speaking. A value that is too high may result in the speech-to-text engine waiting too long for the caller to speak.

### Initial DTMF

Sometimes, users will use call forwarding to reach the number in Fonoster. Some telephony service providers require a Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) to be played before connecting the call. The *initialDtmf* property allows you to specify a DTMF to play when the session starts.

### Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

The *vad* object allows you to configure the voice activity detection settings. Voice activity detection is used to detect when the caller is speaking and when they are not speaking.

The *vad* object has the *activationThreshold*, *deactivationThreshold*, *debounceFrames* properties. The *actionThreshold* property is the activation threshold for voice activity detection. The *deactivationThreshold* property is the deactivation threshold for voice activity detection. The *debounceFrames* property is the number of frames to debounce the voice activity detection.

A lower activation threshold will make the detection more sensitive to the caller's speech. A higher activation threshold will make detecting voice activity less sensitive to the caller's speech.

A lower deactivation threshold will result in more aggressive voice activity detection deactivation. A higher deactivation threshold will result in less aggressive voice activity detection deactivation.

The *debounceFrames* parameter introduces a delay mechanism that ensures that transitions between "speech" and "non-speech" states are stable and not too sensitive to small fluctuations in the input audio signal. Here's how it works:

By requiring multiple consecutive frames (debounceFrames) to confirm speech or non-speech, the system filters out short bursts of noise or brief gaps in speech that might otherwise cause erratic state changes.

## Langue model configuration

The *languageModel* object allows you to define the language model the Autopilot uses. The language model is responsible for generating responses to the user's input.

The following is a list of the supported settings:

| Setting       | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| provider      | The provider of the language model. Supported providers are `openai`, `groq`, and `ollama`      |
| model         | The model to use. The available models depend on the provider                                   |
| maxTokens     | The maximum number of tokens the language model can generate in a single response               |
| temperature   | The randomness of the language model. A higher temperature will result in more random responses |
| knowledgeBase | A list of knowledge bases to use for the language model                                         |
| tools         | A list of tools to use for the language model                                                   |

### LLM providers and models

The Autopilot supports multiple language model providers. The following is a list of the supported providers:

| Provider | Description                                                | Supported models                                                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI   | OpenAI provides various GPT models for conversational AI   | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4-turbo`                    |
| Groq     | Groq offers high-performance AI models optimized for speed | `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `llama-3.3-70b-specdec`, `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| Ollama   | Self-hosted Ollama models                                  | `llama3-groq-tool-use`                                                     |

<Info>
  We have noticed that Groq models, particularly `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, often require greater prompting specificity for effective tool usage. We will share best practices to ensure more consistent behavior as we gain more insights

### Knowledge bases

Coming soon...

### Tools

Fonoster's Autopilot allows you to use tools to enhance the conversational experience. Tools are used to perform specific actions during the conversation.

### Built-in tools

The following is a list of built-in tools available for an agent:

| Tool     | Description                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| hangup   | A tool to end the conversation               |
| transfer | A tool to transfer the call to a live agent  |
| hold     | A tool to put the call on hold (Coming soon) |

### Custom tools

## Adding a Custom Tool

You can add custom tools under `intelligence.config.languageModel.tools`, which is an array where each tool is defined as an object. These tools enable your assistant to interact with external services, APIs, or execute specific actions.

Each tool must follow the [tool schema](https://github.com/fonoster/fonoster/blob/main/mods/common/src/assistants/tools/toolSchema.ts), for consistency and compatibility.

### Example: Adding a Tool to Retrieve Available Appointment Times

The following example demonstrates how to add a custom tool that fetches available appointment times for a specific date:

```yaml
name: getAvailableTimes
description: Get available appointment times for a specific date.
requestStartMessage: "I'm looking for available appointment times for the date you provided."
parameters:
  type: object
  properties:
    date:
      type: string
      format: date
  required:
    - date
operation:
  method: get
  url: https://api.example.com/appointment-times
  headers:
    x-api-key: your-api-key
```

### Key Components of a Tool Definition:

- **`name`**: A unique identifier for the tool
- **`description`**: A brief explanation of what the tool does
- **`requestStartMessage`**: The message sent when the tool is triggered
- **`parameters`**: Defines the expected input structure in accordance with the [JSON Schema standard](https://json-schema.org/), which is also required for OpenAI compatible tool calling
  - **`type`**: Defines the structure of the input (typically `object`)
  - **`properties`**: Specifies the fields expected in the input
  - **`required`**: Lists the fields that must be provided
- **`operation`**:
  - **`method`**: The HTTP method (`get`, `post`, etc.)
  - **`url`**: The endpoint that the assistant will call
  - **`headers`**: Any necessary headers, such as authentication keys

For additional details, refer to the [tool schema documentation](https://github.com/fonoster/fonoster/blob/main/mods/common/src/assistants/tools/toolSchema.ts).


<Tip>
  Use `operation.type` "post" for POST requests. If you want the Autopilot to wait for POST requests to complete, set `operation.waitForResponse` to `true`. For "get" requests, the Autopilot will wait for the response by default.
