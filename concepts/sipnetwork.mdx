Fonoster's SIP Network provides a robust infrastructure for handling Voice over IP (VoIP) communications powered by [Routr.io.](https://routr.io) This foundation enables integration between modern applications and traditional telephony systems through the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

## Overview

The SIP Network in Fonoster is designed with a telephony-first approach, making it particularly powerful for:

- Connecting legacy SIP-based systems with modern applications
- Enabling voice communications across different networks
- Managing complex routing scenarios between various endpoints
- Providing secure and controlled access to telephony resources

## SIP elements

The SIP Network consists of several key components that work together to enable voice communications:

### Domains

A Domain represents a logical grouping of SIP resources. It defines the scope and boundaries for SIP communications and includes routing policies, access control rules, and context settings for SIP addressing.

### Agents

Agents are SIP endpoints that can initiate and receive calls within a Domain. These could be SIP phones, Softphones, SIP-enabled applications, and Browser-based softphones like [SIP.js](https://sipjs.com/).

### Numbers

Numbers represent telephone numbers in the system and define how calls are routed to/from the PSTN network and mapping between telephone numbers and SIP addresses.

 You can also define the geographic information associated with a number.

### Trunks

Trunks provide connectivity to external networks, particularly PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) connectivity, connections to other SIP providers, and gateway services for external communications.

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

ACLs provide security by controlling which IP addresses can access the system, what operations are allowed, and access patterns and restrictions.

ACLs in Fonoster operate at the Domain level.

## Routing types

Fonoster's SIP Network supports various routing scenarios:

### Agent-to-Agent

It enables direct communication between Agents within the same domain, which is ideal for internal communications.

### Agent-to-PSTN

Allows agents to make calls to external telephone numbers through configured trunks.

### PSTN-to-Agent

Enables incoming calls from external telephone numbers to reach specific agents.

## Key benefits

Fonoster's SIP Network architecture provides several advantages:

1. **Legacy integration**: Interconnection with traditional telephony systems with modern applications

2. **Flexibility**: Support for various routing scenarios and communication patterns

3. **Security**: Built-in access control and authentication mechanisms

4. **Scalability**: Distributed architecture supporting growth in usage and complexity

5. **Standards compliance**: Implementation based on established SIP protocols and standards

## Use cases

The SIP Network is particularly valuable for:

- Contact Centers integrating with existing telephony infrastructure
- Voice applications requiring PSTN connectivity
- Organizations modernizing legacy phone systems
- Businesses requiring complex call routing scenarios
- Applications needing secure voice communication capabilities

By leveraging Fonoster's SIP Network, developers can build sophisticated voice applications while maintaining compatibility with traditional telephony systems and modern communication needs.
